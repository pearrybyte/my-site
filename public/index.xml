      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had a good day today. I was visited by a friend of mine and I showed them around my hometown! It made me realize how fortunate I am to live where I am and I am once again thankful to my parents for relocating us in a city with many fruitful opportunities and activities. I could say that I would&amp;rsquo;ve been better off if I stayed back in my birth[place but I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t change it for the world, my lived experiences taught me a lot about love and perseverance - despite always struggling with it lol.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
