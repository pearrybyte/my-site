Hey, how are you?

From what I remembered at this exact date and time you're in the middle of your extreme diet and as of right now I would say that it backfired as my body can no longer handle normal diets anymore. 

But besides that fiasco, I wish you would loved yourself more. 

You rely your self worth on external sources, which affects your mood, your diet, and your motivations. And I honestly think you're really annoying and very sporadic with your emotions, I wish you weren't like that. But I need to give you some grace since you're just a 17 year old that isn't in an emotionally stable environment.

Now where am I going with this? I'm not sure. I just wish that you handled your relationships better, right now I feel the effects of it even until now. And it is quite dreadful. But i've been doing better. One thing I miss about you is your motivation and consistency, it's definitely something that I need to regain. I think I am much happier with a consistent schedule, having nothing to do makes me spiral a bit too much. But besides that, I feel like i'm learning all the things I would have learned if I were to be in a healthy environment when I was your age. I want to continue to grow, I feel like i've been much more self-assured lately and that the universe is leading me towards something great. 

I recently bought tarot cards and they have been heavily aligned with what's going on with my life right now. Though something it did warn me from is to beware of repeating old cycles and I might be struggling with that a bit, but I know that each day I am getting better and better. I would like to say that I am happier than ever but I'm still unsure. I've been making new friends, seeing friends, and have started to do things a bit more independently. Independence is really important, I felt like it was something i've lost throughout these past few years. Only recently was when I started growing out of the shell of seeking external validation. Despite this whole thing being a struggle, I'm glad to have become even more aware of patterns and instances that i've learned from and can now avoid in the future. I am happy to have grown as I am today, and I hope I have made you proud.
